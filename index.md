## About Me

I am currently a Ph.D. student at the Department of Aerospace Engineering, Indian Institute of Science, Bengaluru. I am working under the supervision of [[Prof. Vivekanand Dabade](http://aero.iisc.ac.in/people/vivekanand-dabade/)]. We work on problems lying at the broad intersection of mechanics, mathematics and materials science. 

## Research Interests

- **Computational and Continuum Mechanics:** linear and non-linear elasticity
- **Micromagnetics**
- **Fluid-structure interactions** 
- **Biomechanics**
- **Parallel computing**
- **Flow instabilities**

## Education

- Master of Technology (Aerospace Engineering), **Indian Institute of Science**, Bengaluru
- Bachelor of Engineering (Aerospace Engineering), **Punjab Engineering College**, Chandigarh
